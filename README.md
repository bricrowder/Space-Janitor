# Space-Janitor

One of the earlier things I did (that I still have).  A simple schmup.

Uses love 10.x I believe.  It looks like it was written before I understood the spritesheets/quads were.  Pretty neat though.

I am going to slowly pick away at a space janitor 2, see the repo.

Check out the distribution folder for the executable.  It worked as expected the last time I ran it.  I also have the .love file if you want it in that format.
